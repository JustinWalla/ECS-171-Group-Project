ECS 171 Group Project - Joshua Hernandez, Justin Wallasch

Our dataset, found on this github repo, has been cropped to only have the most important data. Some columns were deemed redundant and non-necessary to have for our network.
Preprocessing the data was pruning these non-necessary columns, creating columns like score, and pass_yards/att/cmp that we deemed to be the most necessary.
We then normalized the dataset after. More information about our work can be found in the jupyter notebook. Thank you!

Update #2 (Preprocessing and First Model Building, 11/27)
-Changed Dataframe to add opposition statistics as extra columns
-Added new "fumbles lost" column
-Cleaned up any NA's in the data
-Successfully built first model!
